# Project Proposal: Fitness Tracking App

## Objective
Develop a comprehensive Project Requirement Document (PRD) with an architecture outline for the Fitness Tracking App. The document will detail the core functionalities, design, and additional feature categories.


## Development Methodology
Following Agile methodology, we will iterate on the PRD based on user feedback and testing. The project will be broken down into milestones, with requirements continuously updated.

## Description
The PRD will serve as the foundation for the Fitness Tracking App, outlining all the necessary features and architectural considerations. This document acts as a contract equivalent, ensuring clarity on deliverables.

## Feature Categories
### Required (Core Functionality)
- User Registration & Authentication
- Set Fitness Goals (e.g., run 5 miles/week, workout 3 times/week)
- Progress Tracking (Visual Charts, Streaks, Weekly Summaries)
- Daily/Weekly Habit Tracking (e.g., water intake, steps walked)
- Workout Recommendations (AI-powered based on progress)
- Dynamic Reminders (Adaptive notifications based on user activity)
- Secure User Data Storage (Firebase/PostgreSQL/MongoDB)
- Responsive UI (Material Design/Tailwind UI)

### Desired (Enhanced Usability & Appearance)
- Gamification Elements (Streak Rewards, Badges)
- Social Features (Friend Leaderboards, Challenge Mode)
- AI-Powered Behavior Prediction (Detect workout skips, send motivation)
- Dark Mode Support

### Aspirational (Standout Features)
- Voice & Gesture-Based Navigation
- AR-Based Workout Guidance
- Wearable Device Integration (Sync with smartwatches)
- Offline Mode (Track progress without internet access)

## Goals
- **Usability:** Design intuitive workflows with embedded design images to simulate real user interactions.
- **Efficiency:** Ensure requirements are clear before development to avoid costly revisions later.
- **Scalability:** Plan for future enhancements with a flexible architecture.

## Development Process
1. **Requirement Gathering:** Research user needs and compile detailed features.
2. **Wireframing & Design:** Link to earlier design images and ensure UI/UX clarity.
3. **Architecture Planning:** Define API endpoints, database schema, and integration points.
4. **Task Breakdown:** Convert requirements into GitHub issues and assign to team members.
5. **Iterative Updates:** Update PRD based on feedback and evolving project scope.

This document will serve as a guiding framework for the successful execution of the Fitness Tracking App. Regular updates will ensure alignment with project goals and usability standards.
