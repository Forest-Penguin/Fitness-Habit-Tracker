# Project Requirement Document (PRD)

## Overview
The Fitness Tracking App is designed to help users achieve their health and wellness goals by providing a comprehensive platform to track fitness progress, monitor daily habits, and receive AI-driven workout recommendations. With a focus on usability, scalability, and offline accessibility, this app aims to stand out through its intuitive interface, engaging gamification features, and future-ready architecture. The development process will leverage industry-standard technologies to ensure high performance and adaptability.

## Objective
Develop a Fitness Tracking App that empowers users to set and track fitness goals, monitor daily habits, and receive AI-powered workout recommendations. The app will feature a responsive UI, secure local data storage, and offline functionality.

## Development Methodology
We will follow Agile methodology, breaking the project into milestones with iterative updates based on user feedback. Requirements will be continuously refined to ensure alignment with project goals.

## Tech Stack
### Frontend: React Native (JavaScript)
Why? Best for developers familiar with React
- Tools: React Native, Expo(for fast prototyping)
- Pros: Large community, works for both Android & iOS
- Cons: Requires third-party libraries for some native features

### Backend: Flask (Python)
Why? Easy to integrate AI models (TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- Tools: Flask, FastAPI, Gunicorn (for deployment)
- Pros: Simple to set up, good for AI-based API
- Cons: Requires a separate cloud server (AWS/GCP)

### Database: SQLite (Local Storage)
- Pros: No internet required, lightweight
- Cons: Limited querying power

## Core Features
### 1. User Registration & Authentication
- Email/password authentication
- Token-based session management
### 2. Set Fitness Goals
- Create personalized goals (e.g., "Run 5 miles/week")
- Track progress against goals with visual feedback
### 3. Progress Tracking
- Interactive charts to display progress
- Weekly summaries and streak tracking
### 4. Daily/Weekly Habit Tracking
- Log habits like water intake, steps, or workouts
- Provide visual feedback on habit completion
### 5. Workout Recommendations
- AI-powered suggestions based on user progress and preferences
### 6. Dynamic Reminders
- Notifications adapt to user activity (e.g., "You missed today's goal")
### 7. Secure User Data Storage
- Encrypt sensitive data stored locally with SQLite
### 8. Responsive UI
- Material Design-inspired UI with intuitive navigation

## Enhanced Usability & Appearance (Desired)
### 1. Gamification Elements

- Enable hands-free control for accessibility
### 2. AR-Based Workout Guidance
- Augmented reality visuals for guided workouts
### 3. Wearable Device Integration
- Sync with smartwatches to capture activity data
### 4. Offline Mode
- Ensure users can log progress without internet access

## Development Process
### 1. Requirement Gathering
- Research target users and document detailed feature requirements
### 2. Wireframing & Design
- Create wireframes and high-fidelity mockups for all screens
### 3. Architecture Planning
- Define API endpoints, database schema, and integration workflows
### 4. Task Breakdown
- Convert requirements into tasks on GitHub and assign to team members
### 5. Prototyping
- Use Expo for quick prototyping and user testing
### 6. Iterative Updates
- Refine the PRD based on feedback and evolving project scope
