# Security Issues in Fitness Tracking App

## Introduction
Security vulnerabilities pose risks to user data and app integrity. We focus on encryption, secure authentication, and regular security audits to mitigate threats.

## Potential Risks & Mitigation Strategies

### 1. Data Protection & Encryption
- **Risk:** User data could be exposed during transmission or storage.
- **Mitigation:** Use HTTPS for data transmission, encrypt sensitive information (AES-256), and implement SQLite encryption for local storage.

### 2. Authentication & Authorization
- **Risk:** Weak authentication could allow unauthorized access.
- **Mitigation:** Implement OAuth2, two-factor authentication (2FA), and enforce secure session management practices.

### 3. Common Web Vulnerabilities & Attack Vectors
#### a. SQL Injection (SQLi)
- **Risk:** Attackers could manipulate database queries.
- **Mitigation:** Use parameterized queries and ORM with SQLite.

#### b. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Risk:** Malicious scripts could be injected into the frontend.
- **Mitigation:** Escape user input and implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers.

#### c. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- **Risk:** Attackers could trick users into executing unauthorized actions.
- **Mitigation:** Use CSRF tokens for form submissions and API authentication.

#### d. Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks
- **Risk:** Excessive API requests could overwhelm the server.
- **Mitigation:** Implement rate limiting with Flask and monitor traffic patterns.

### 4. Security Best Practices
- Conduct regular penetration testing and vulnerability assessments.
- Perform code reviews to detect and fix security flaws.
- Keep dependencies updated to patch known vulnerabilities.
