Architecture Document

1. Overview

This document provides an overview of the architecture for the Fitness Tracking App. It outlines the major components of the system, including user management, activity tracking, habit logging, and AI-powered workout recommendations.

2. Languages/Frameworks/Libraries/Services/APIs

Languages:

Python: Backend logic for activity tracking, user authentication, AI recommendations, and data processing.

JavaScript: Frontend development using React Native for cross-platform mobile application.

Frameworks:

React Native: For building the mobile application UI, compatible with both iOS and Android.

Flask (Python): Backend API development for handling requests, data processing, and AI integration.

Libraries:

SQLAlchemy (Python): ORM for database interactions.

requests (Python): For API communication.

TensorFlow/PyTorch: For implementing AI-powered workout recommendation models.

Firebase Authentication: User authentication and authorization.

Chart.js: For rendering activity and progress charts.

Redux (JavaScript): For state management in the frontend.

Services/APIs:

Strava API: For syncing user activity data.

Google Fit API / Apple HealthKit: For retrieving health metrics.

Firebase Firestore: Cloud-based database for storing user data.

Expo: For fast prototyping and testing of the React Native app.

3. Package/Build Manager

NPM: Manages JavaScript dependencies for React Native.

Pip: Manages Python libraries for backend and data processing.

4. Task Assignments

Person 1: Frontend development using React Native (UI/UX design, implementing activity tracking, habit logging, and dashboard views).

Person 2: Backend API development with Flask (user authentication, data processing, syncing with APIs, and AI model integration).

Person 3: Integration with fitness APIs (Strava, Google Fit, Apple HealthKit; managing API tokens and requests).

Person 4: Database design and implementation (Firestore setup, schema design, managing user data storage).

Person 5: Visualization and analytics (building activity charts, habit tracking, and generating insights).

5. Deployment

Mobile Deployment: The app will be deployed to both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.

Cloud Deployment: Backend services will be hosted on Firebase and/or AWS.

6. Development/Deployment Environments

Development Environment: Each developer will set up React Native and Flask locally. Emulators (iOS Simulator, Android Emulator) will be used for testing mobile features.

Deployment Environment: Firebase for authentication and database, AWS or Google Cloud for hosting the backend API services.
