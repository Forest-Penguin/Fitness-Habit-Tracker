# Legal Issues in Fitness Tracking App

## Introduction
Ensuring legal compliance protects both users and developers from liabilities. Our app follows necessary regulations, respects intellectual property, and prevents unlawful use.

## Potential Risks & Mitigation Strategies

### 1. Third-Party Licensing Compliance
- **Risk:** Using external tools (React Native, Flask, Expo) requires adherence to their respective licenses.
- **Mitigation:** Review all dependencies and ensure proper licensing compliance before integration.

### 2. User-Generated Content & Copyright
- **Risk:** Users may upload or share copyrighted fitness plans, violating intellectual property laws.
- **Mitigation:** Implement content moderation, automated copyright detection, and clear terms of service.

### 3. Compliance with Data Protection Laws (GDPR, CCPA)
- **Risk:** Data collection and storage must comply with regulations like GDPR (EU) and CCPA (California).
- **Mitigation:** Provide a transparent privacy policy, allow users to request data deletion, and implement secure data handling practices.

### 4. User Liability for Misuse
- **Risk:** Users might misuse the app (e.g., falsifying data, using it for unintended purposes).
- **Mitigation:** Define clear terms of use, implement fraud detection mechanisms, and enforce fair usage policies.
